sHqNiID4VY0,Python Simplified,DON'T USE AI - MAKE AI! A Bright Future Where We Are Indispensable and ChatGPT is Unemployed,"Folks, the future of our industry is a million times better than I imagined!!!
It's embedded in our purpose - we are not users! we are makers! 
So why would anybody use a pre-made AI model such as ChatGPT when we are perfectly capable of designing a much better model on our own? 🤔
Imagine a future where each of us makes our very own custom AI model, unique and tailored to our needs - not to the needs of a company with millions of users with millions of different problems which in most cases are irrelevant to us.

Our creation will reflect our personal qualities, skills, interests, and yes - even our biases. Our models will carry our features and since we are different from one another - our models will be different too. This is how we can keep the balance and become INDISPENSABLE.

INDISPENSABLE = NO ONE WILL EVER BE ABLE TO REPLACE US WITH ANYTHING! 
Your employer can have ChatGPT and use it as they wish - but they will never be able to replicate the much more powerful proprietary model that only you possess. 
Why? because rather than a model that knows a little bit about everything - our creation will know everything about a little bit. It will be specific to the type of tasks we decide on. An enhanced version of ourselves that no one but us can access.

A system that is made with such a large variety of unique components - can never be centralized. Our models will run wild and free just like our imagination.

My task is to provide you with a template of such a model and then you'll need to customize it as you wish. You'll decide on the type of components your model will have, the type of data it will learn, the type of algorithms, and all the fine details. I will explain each line of code and concept in great detail until you have all the tools to start your own AI journey with full confidence.

Do you already possess a special set of skills in the realm of AI or deep learning? Do you want to help me? Please connect with me either here in the comments or find my full contact information below.

Please note, this video is a follow-up to the:
⭐ My Previous ChatGPT Vlog:
       https://youtu.be/jIZWlmGPpWA
Where I brought up some potential issues that may arise in our industry given the extensive use of pre-made models, free of charge and available to all.
I want to ❤️THANK YOU ❤️ for taking the time to share your perspective, arguments, visions of the future, and possible solutions! 
I have never received so many comments on anything in my life! and I would have never come up with this idea if it wasn't for your input! 
Our little YouTube community has started a pivotal discussion that many have ignored and it showcased that our greatest strength is in the variety of points of view. No comment was similar to another, and no testimony was repeating somebody else's words. We're unique but not alone, there are millions who agree with us and millions who disagree, and even so - no one is just quite like us.
Together, we make an unstoppable, singular but decentralized system and as long as we remember that - we will always prevail 💪💪💪
Thank you so much again for taking the time to prove me right or prove me wrong. And as with everything, I was a bit of both.

jIZWlmGPpWA,Python Simplified,My Thoughts On ChatGPT - PULL THE PLUG BEFORE IT LAYS EGGS!!!,"🛑Good News!! I found a solution!!! 🛑
Please check out my follow-up vlog that will really improve your mood! 😀: https://youtu.be/sHqNiID4VY0

In this video, I will share why I haven't been filming any ChatGPT tutorials.
I've seen your comments and requests, and I know you're looking forward to seeing my take. However, there's something very important that my tech content creator colleagues seem to ignore when it comes to this highly sophisticated AI model. 
Sure, it's so trendy and popular that even the most useless of tutorials will bring millions of viewers your way. It's very tempting, and I don't judge you if you seized the opportunity... I have almost done it too! But I can't help but feel there's something terribly wrong with it and I must share my reasoning with you.

I'm not scared of new technology, this channel is 100% Artificial Intelligence friendly, and frankly - AI and Machine Learning are the reasons why I've started learning Python! (If you view this channel for quite some time - you already know that 😉)
My appreciation of AI, however, doesn't prevent me from recognizing its negative aspects or admitting that they exist in the first place. This is the perfect time to have a conversation about what the future may bring and how well we are adapted to it. 
hint: if ChatGPT codes better than you - you need to catch up and surpass it fast!!!

So please let me know in the comment below if you agree or disagree because either way - we must have a valuable discussion before we promote irreversible changes to our industry. 
Peace and love, my friends! ✌️😻

p3tSLatmGvU,Python Simplified,Convert GUI App to Real Program -  Python to exe to setup wizard,"You've just made a beautiful GUI app with Python - but there's a big difference between creating an app for your personal use and distributing it all across the web, reaching many people who don't necessarily know anything about Python. 
In this tutorial, I will show you exactly how to convert your Tkinter, Kivy, KivyMD, PyQT5, or other GUIs into a full-blown professional program! 🤩🤩🤩
The end result is a 😱 SINGLE SETUP FILE 😱 which anyone can download and install on their computer - even your grandmom!!! 👵
We will use Pyinstaller to create an executable file and Inno Setup to bundle it with dependencies and convert them into a setup wizard. 
In addition, we will discuss some common errors, how to fix them and how to avoid irrelevant instructions (hint: do we really need to modify the SPEC file? 🤔)
We will briefly tackle licensing (open source, as you may guess 😉), and generating icons.
Please note, this video is designed for Windows developers and users! However, I will cover Linux and Mac as well in some future tutorials... the Mac tutorial is of course inspired by Tom! XDD (but only members of our Discord community will understand the joke, this is how I test if they read video descriptions 😅)

BgyUJk0U49I,Python Simplified,Software Prototype - Can You Help Me Test it?,"It's been a while, folks! and I am (almost) back! will catch up with your comments shortly! 😁😁😁
I have 3 more days to finish a university midterm report and then Python Simplified is back in full gear! 🦾🦾🦾
The reason why I'm streaming today is to see if you can help me test a prototype of a really cool software that was designed as part of UoL's Agile Software Development module.
Your feedback (which basically consists of a very short survey of 5 questions) will be evaluated and submitted anonymously along with my midterm paper.

If you're curious - the midterm paper focuses on something called ""deliverable components"" (which is just fancy words for a formal software proposition). 
The main point is - before we even write a single line of code - we must develop a well-defined plan! this plan includes market research, defining stakeholders, setting requirements, prototyping and of course user testing (which I am hoping you can help me with! ;)

Here's a public link to my interactive prototype on Figma (make sure to click on the purple chrome extension icon with the ""A"" on it to display the UI of the software - I will demonstrate exactly how to interact with the prototype at beginning of the stream 😉).
https://www.figma.com/proto/MdSRCMTTxuGLShvdvrG18Z/Automator_V1?node-id=1%3A9&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A9

Once you have reviewed everything, please fill up this super quick form (I'm not even collecting names or emails - just your honest opinion):
https://forms.gle/eBVkDPy9QAZsmXh39

Now please keep in mind that this is a group project and this prototype was created as part of a teamwork experience. I am presenting it, but other folks are also involved in developing the idea behind this software.

aSeqMYNhEHo,Python Simplified,The Ultimate Guide to Selenium Bots - Automating Twitter,"In this video we will explore the art of bot making for the purpose of understanding how it's being used against us 🤖🤖🤖
We will create a simple retweeting bot that searches for posts that contain a certain keyword like: ""cat"" or ""dog"" and then retweets selected posts with a quoted message.
The code and the lesson-flow I will demonstrate does not contain any unethical practices: we use a single account and we automate it for harmless purposes. However the techniques you will learn can be applied on different use cases ☢️☢️ so PLEASE use this information responsibly!!! ☢️☢️

EEiqGjCNLRs,Python Simplified,Django QuickStart Web Application for Beginners,"Welcome to the QuickStart guide to Django Applications! 🤩
Where Django is a popular Python-based framework for web development and today we will set it up from scratch!

In this tutorial we will focus on some the main components of websites. We will:
1. Setup a Django development server using Python (01:46)
2. Render an HTML template (05:18)
3. Add some CSS Styling (13:26)
4. And last but not least - JavaScript client side interactions (20:24)

🛑 PLEASE KEEP IN MIND 🛑
-----------------------------------------------
This is a QUICKSTART guide with the sole purpose of connecting all the above components together! By the end of this tutorial you will have your very own template of a basic Django website and you will also learn which files and terms we use for different operations.
Or alternatively, you can just clone my code if you already have some background with Django:
https://github.com/MariyaSha/DjangoQuickstart

In the next few tutorials we will learn how to work with Django databases and templating engine! After we have all the basics covered - we will then move with creating a useful application and even hosting it online.

Otr6BW-uKFs,Python Simplified,Zip Vs Range - Which is Faster? Benchmarking YOUR code suggestions too!,"In my recent Dictionary Comprehension tutorial, I've asked you which of the two approaches you think is faster - zip or range? today we will empirically measure the speed of both algorithms within for loops and within comprehensions.
In addition, I've collected a few of YOUR code examples from the comment section (which is even more exciting to benchmark 😉)
Checkout my recent tutorial here for more information:
⭐ Dictionary Comprehension:
       https://youtu.be/khCzymLy_QE

For this stream, I'm borrowing Badger's benchmarking code. You can find it on Github and use it on your own functions 😀:
https://gist.github.com/JBraunsmaJr/c79d096626b84517fa29f817da39df58

Originally Badger's code was meant to check whether LIST comprehensions are faster than for loops and under which condition. It came up in the viewer comments of another recent tutorial:
⭐ List Comprehension:
https://youtu.be/SNq4C988FjU

In other words - this stream will introduce us to advanced concepts of analyzing algorithms and their running time. So it's not about just making things work, but making them work efficiently! 💪💪💪

Also, I figured out what to do with shorts! Will tell you all about it in this stream! See you soon! 😍

🧑‍⚖️  Judging Criteria 🧑‍⚖️ 
-----------------------------------------------------
To win the code jam you'll need to impress our favorite team of moderators, this time myself included! 😉
We haven't changed the judging criteria from the last jam, so here are the general guidelines we'll take in consideration:

1. creativity - blow our mind and go as far as your imagination takes you!
2. code clarity - can somebody other than the team members understand the code? is it nice and neat with commentary?
3. innovation - has anybody ever seen something like this before? or was it implemented in such way?
4. functionality - does it work? 🤪 did you deliver what you intended to deliver?
5. user experience - how convenient is your app/service for the average user?
6. design - how appealing are the aesthetics? do you like how everything looks? (personal taste situation)
7. modularity and separation of concerns - different pieces of functionality are logically separated, your HTML is in a different file than your CSS or Python, etc.
8. teamwork - did all the active team members contributed to the efforts? did anybody leave the jam before the due date?
9. clear README documentation - please make sure you give us a briefing of your project along with the dependencies, authors and sources (if any).
10. clever control flow - smart use of conditional statements, loops, list comprehension, etc.
11. EFFORT!!! if you put lots of hard work in your project but something went wrong - we will take that into consideration.

K4LAjQgsWUE,Python Simplified,Create Twitter Bot with Python Selenium while Streaming live,"🛑🛑 This Tutorial was REFILMED!!! 🛑🛑
Please check out the MUCH BETTER version:
https://youtu.be/aSeqMYNhEHo

In todays tutorial we will learn how to automate Twitter processes, or in other words - we will create an extra friendly liking bot!  🤖🤖🤖
This live streaming tutorial is perfect for beginners! all you need is to have Python installed on your system (I'm using Python 3.9 in case you'd like to match versions 🤪) and we will take care of everything else together!

Complete tutorial code can be found on my Github:
https://github.com/MariyaSha/TwitterBot

The main purpose of this stream is to reflect on how easy it is to set up bots on social media platforms. Additionally, we will discuss whether you think it's good or bad - are extra layers of protection required? or do you like the current ""wild wild west"" situation? 🙃
And even though our bot is going to be fluffy and harmless - can you imagine what experienced black hats with malicious intents have been doing with this technology throughout the years? (hint: phishing, impersonating and other fraud-related issues)

So I propose this experiment - will Twitter ever detect our bots? and how soon will this happen? (if at all)

🛑 BEFORE THE STREAM BEGINS 🛑
_____________________________________
⭐ Please make sure you have Python installed on your computer! 
       If you're not sure how, please checkout my Anaconda installation tutorial:
       https://youtu.be/MUZtVEDKXsk
⭐ Please make sure you have a ⚠️ dummy Twitter account ⚠️ in advance!
       This cannot be your personal account!! don't risk it!

🛑 WILL WE GET IN TROUBLE? 🛑
_____________________________________
one way to avoid trouble is to use a dummy account that is not associated with your personal account. (with that said, I've used my personal social media accounts multiple times for scraping 😅😅😅 needless to say that nothing happened, but keep in mind that your account may be suspended or God forbid deleted if it's labeled as a bot... it's probably not worth the risk!)

Also, everything I cover in this tutorial can be easily found in the Selenium documentation:
https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/
Selenium is a popular tool that many developers use on a daily basis. I encourage you to do your own research and find out for yourself whether bot-making suits you or not 😀

UsqJhrkvukU,Python Simplified,RTX 3080Ti Giveaway Stream - Good Luck Everybody!,"Joy of Joys Dream of Dreams!! 🤩🤩🤩
The very first live stream of Python Simplified is finally here!!! And the best part is - one of you is going to WIN an Nvidia RTX 3080Ti Graphics Card!!! 🥳
But wait - there's more! there's an additional runner up prize of 5 DLI credits which will take your programming skills to the next level!

So how this draw works? In the past month, you guys have registered to the giveaway by following the rules from my announcement video:
https://youtu.be/NVq2PDqwtnc
(the rules and privacy information can be found in the description of the video above)

I've read all your emails and personally checked each and every entry (I even notified folks who were missing files to correct their submission 😊 if you're noticing this only now - I will accept the missing files up until April 23rd 8am where the .csv file for the draw will be finalized!! I'm still waiting for a few people to respond, hopefully they will when they see this scheduled stream 😉)

I've entered the names of the participants in a special .csv file, and we will determine who wins with a random.shuffle() command! The name at index 0 is the winner of the GPU and the name at index 1 is the winner of the DLI credits!  😁😁😁

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
Since I don't know where you guys live - if the laws of Canada or your country of residence prevent me from shipping you the GPU, I will have to find another way to reward you.
If the problem is shipping the product itself - I'll design you a very nice custom apparel item with your name and a special dedication from myself.
If the problem is shipping in general - I'll come up with an online reward instead! 😀
The laws of your/my country are more important than my giveaway rules and there's only a handful or countries that Canada Post is not delivering to.

Once the stream is over, I will email the GPU winner and request their contact detail. In terms of the DLI credits - you will get them via email as well, right after the stream 😊

See you soon folks!",,2022-04-24T07:37:10Z,5797,328,,33,PT1H52M50S,hd,false
lLRBYKwP8GQ,Python Simplified,Ultimate Guide to NumPy Arrays - VERY DETAILED TUTORIAL for beginners!,"In this tutorial, we will learn about NumPy arrays in great detail! 🤓 
NumPy is one of the most popular Python libraries and just as it sounds - it deals with numbers! 
An array, on the other hand,  is a collection of items of the same type and it's the data structure that NumPy uses.
This video will give you the tools and demos to understand how NumPy manages data and how it approaches memory consumption. 

We will explore different functions and methods to:
⭐ create N-dimensional arrays
⭐ reshape arrays
⭐ sort arrays with different algorithms
⭐ filter and manipulate array values

The goal of this Ultimate Guide (and all the future Ultimate Guides I'll be filming for other libraries) - is to cover a HUGE part of the NumPy documentation. It's meant for all the folks who learn by example rather than by reading dry text and hopefully this will take your NumPy skills to an expert level! 🥼🥼🥼

v7_tKr9PD4s,Python Simplified,Reviewing Your Projects!,"Today's video is dedicated entirely to YOUR projects! 😊
We will see 5 different applications created by viewers who participated in our recent code jam. We will visit their Github repositories, test the applications and discuss points of interest within their code. So if you're interested in Pygame, OpenCV, Dash, Next.js, React, Flask, ESDR, SQLAlchemy, Tkinter - you're definitely up for a treat!! 😀

So what projects are we dealing with??
⭐ VMagnify was able to mercilessly beat Photoshop's upscaling techniques by 
      using the ESDR algorithm!!! 😱
      In the video you will see a comparison between 2 of the most powerful 
      Photoshop algorithms (Bicubic Smoother and Preserve Detail 0.2) and VMagnify -
      prepare to be shocked!!! 😀😀😀
⭐ CyberSpider was able to seamlessly combine a news fetching API in their website and 
      rebelled against Python with an incredibly stylish Next.js and React application! 🥳🥳🥳
      They've applied professional Separation of Concerns principles to create an extra modular
      website providing articles which were automatically pulled from multiple sources! 
⭐ LockBox was able to beautifully combine Tkinter with a Sqlite and SQLAlchemy, 
      which is something many viewers were asking me about! 😀
      They've professionally handled password encryption using a Hash Function and the SHA256
      algorithm, along with database management techniques and real-time updates.
⭐ Fire Scan was able to combine HTTP/HTTPS requests in their web service, evaluate the
      headers of a given site and determine just how secure a given website is!
      They've also provided detailed information regarding each security risk, classifying its severity.
⭐ The Maze of the Navigation Team is fully utilizing randomness and mastering the Pygame grid.
       A new maze is generated each time the application reloads, along with 2 random entry and 
       exit points. Using OOP principles, the team provided the perfect game world setting which 
       can be expended into a full-blown maze or Pacman style game.

-AlFiS74aQg,Python Simplified,Ultimate Guide to Datetime! Python date and time objects for beginners,"Hi everyone! today we will talk about the Datetime module, which helps us load and manipulate date and time data in Python. The main reason why Datetime is so important is because Python doesn't really have a built-in data type for dates (and times) 🗓️⌚- but we can easily import them from the datetime module! 😀

So in this tutorial - we will discuss and experiment with the most important commands from the documentation, focusing on 3 different classes: date, datetime and time.
We will learn how to create and manipulate each of these and we will also convey them with different formatting methods.

We will focus on a Machine Learning process called Inference (which is when the model is trained, perfected and ready to make a prediction). 
For this we will load a state-of-the-art artificial neural network and we will use it to classify a picture of my cat! 🙀🙀🙀
Specifically - we will borrow ResNet50 for our little Pytorch experiment! 😉 
We will also run a speed test comparing Pytorch models running on CPU, on CUDA and on Torch-TensorRT - which of these do you think is faster??

oF-EMiPZQGA,Python Simplified,Much Better Web Scraping with Pandas - Automatically Extract All Table Elements From a Web Page!,"In this video, I'll show you an INCREDIBLE shortcut for web scraping HTML tables!!!
This shortcut is a single command that skips the entire process of accessing the Developer Tools and finding specific elements on the page! 😱
We will use the 🐼 Pandas read_html method 🐼 - and extract a list of all the table elements found at a given URL (table headers, table data, table rows).
So with this single command - we actually end up solving a problem that took more than 15 minutes to solve in the recent Mechanical Soup tutorial!! 😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫
(which can be found here: https://youtu.be/MkGQmZoMuRM)

But wait... it sounds too good to be true! where's the catch?? 🤪
Unfortunately, this method is restricted to table elements only and it can't be used for traditional web scraping perks such as logging in, filling forms or pressing on buttons. 
However, if scraping HTML tables is exactly what you seek - this tutorial will change your life!!! (well... maybe just slightly 😅)

r9IqwpMR9TE,Python Simplified,CUDA Simply Explained - GPU vs CPU Parallel Computing for Beginners,"In this tutorial, we will talk about CUDA and how it helps us accelerate the speed of our programs. Additionally, we will discuss the difference between processors (CPUs) and graphic cards (GPUs) and how come we can use both to process code.
By the end of this video - we will install CUDA and perform a quick speed test comparing the speed of our GPU with the speed of our CPU. We will create 2 extremely large data structures with PyTorch and we will multiply one by the other to test the performance.
Specifically, I'll be comparing Nvidia's GeForce RTX 3090 GPU with Intel's i9-12900K 12th-Gen Alder Lake Processor (with DDR5 memory).
I'll be posting some more advanced benchmarks in the next few tutorials, as the code I'm demonstrating in this video is 100% beginner-friendly!

X5vRKLuVp58,Python Simplified,My Story of Assembling a Brand New PC Despite Part Shortage - Vlog 5,"In this video, I will tell you all about my PC assembly adventures and how I got my hands on the equipment you see in the background! 😍😍
I went for a brand new 12 gen built (yes, with DDR5!!! I found 32GB of it!!! 😱) with my dream RTX 3090 GPU (which was the component that started this whole assembly journey!)

In the next vlog, I will of course show you this beast after assembly and I will talk in much more detail about each of the parts, how they relate to one another, their specs, as well as exactly why I went for an Asus Rog build! 😀
This vlog is more about overcoming the current semi-conductor supply shortage and NOT GIVING UP!!! 💪💪💪
Keep hustling, keep visiting retailers, keep calling companies across your country and checking for stock arrival ETAs!! (Mid-January is what many companies say - however, I see that some parts have already arrived!)

**********************************

So what were the most difficult parts to get?? 
and 🤩 HOW CAN YOU GET THEM?? 🤩

⭐⭐ DDR5 Memory (RAM) - no online stock anywhere!!! and no backorders!!!
What worked for me: try visiting local retailers AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE! 
They get small quantities of these DDR5 sticks regularly but they end up selling them before they even appear in the inventory!
Also, always ask to speak to a manager as regular employees will most likely not be able to help you! 

⭐⭐ Geforce RTX 3090 GPU - finally available online! 😱😱😱
however, unfortunately - NOT THE FOUNDERS EDITION! 
You can find many other kinds on 🚨Newegg.com🚨 though! They currently have the Rog Strix Edition, MSI Edition, Gigabyte Edition, etc... 
I got mine directly from Nvidia and it will feature in a few upcoming 🐍CUDA and TensorRT 🐍tutorials as a result (both are Machine Learning tools to accelerate the processing time of your code). But I checked the stock on Newegg on the evening of Nov 27th - and there are no shortages!!!! yeeeey! 😀

⭐⭐ Rog Ryujin ii 360 Liquid Cooler - Backordered!
🚨 Please note 🚨 the Rog Ruygin 360 (without ii) appearing in this video is incompatible with my specific build! it doesn't support an LGA 1700 socket which is required by the Maximus motherboard! So ordering a bracket will not help! you'll need a full upgrade kit which I don't believe exists yet! 🙃
You can backorder it through many different retailers, not much stock yet, but you can reserve a spot! It's not semi-conductor related so the shortage is probably not gonna last for long, don't worry! 😁

Ohj-CqALrwk,Python Simplified,SQLite Backend for Beginners - Create Quick Databases with Python and SQL,"🛑 PLEASE NOTE 🛑 we need to add connection.commit() after each data insertion command!!!
This will store all the rows permanently inside ""gta.db"", otherwise you might have trouble selecting from external files!!
Find out exactly how to do it in my follow-up SQLite tutorial: https://youtu.be/MkGQmZoMuRM

Today we will talk about Sqlite, which is a library known for its quick and simple databases. 
It is a database engine using the SQL language, which is probably even more intuitive and closer to plain English than Python (can you believe I'm saying that??? 😱😱😱)
With the help of Python, we will cover all the basics of creating databases, tables, inserting data into those tables, selecting and fetching database rows, searching data within the database and manipulating this data inside our code. All this - in less than 15 minutes!!! 🤩
(no wonder Sqlite is considered to be an incredibly easy library!)

MUZtVEDKXsk,Python Simplified,Anaconda Beginners Guide for Linux and Windows - Python Working Environments Tutorial,"In this video, we will talk about the Anaconda toolkit and how we can use it to make our Python journey a bit more convenient.
🐍 We will talk about working environments and how we can create them on our computer.
🐍 We will also install different versions of Python inside these environments and combine them with a few popular packages.
🐍 We will discuss all the must-know conda commands.
🐍 We will install a conde editor named Jupyter Notebook.

The goal of this tutorial is:
a. to show the convenience of working environments.
b. to answer why I'm using conda in most of my videos 😜

🛑 PLEASE NOTE 🛑
*******************************
I didn't mention it in this tutorial - but you can still install Pygame with Python 3.5 (up to 3.5, newer versions will not work with conda!)
You'll just need to figure out which version of Pygame works with your version of Python!
So is Python 2.7 really a requirement? NO! I shouldn't have phrased it that way... but you might run into issues if you go for a later version! I got lots of questions about it and 2.7 seems to work great for everybody!
So if you got the following error:

UnsatisfiableError: The following specifications were found
to be incompatible with the existing python installation in your environment:
Specifications:
  - pygame - python[version='2.7.*3.5.*']
Your python: python=3.9

Just try combining it with an older version of Python and it should do the trick! 😉

8z2oLfK2sIc,Python Simplified,Machine Learning Databases and How to Access them with Pytorch - MNIST Tutorial,"In this tutorial, we will talk about popular Machine Learning databases and how we can easily access them with Pytorch. 🔥🔥🔥
In particular, we will focus on MNIST, which is a handwritten digits database with 70,000 different images. We will load it with a very simple Pytorch command and we will have a closer look at its content, as well as its feature + label structure.
We will also discuss data transforms, why we need them and how do we decide which transforms work better for what kind of data. 

Other computer vision databases we will briefly discuss are CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST and HMDB51. You can find the full list of available databases and transforms at the very bottom of the description ⬇⬇⬇

f0TrMH9s-VE,Python Simplified,Python Classes and Objects - OOP for Beginners,"In this tutorial, we will learn about Python Classes & Objects in great detail!
I've been promising this for a while now, but we're finally diving into Object-Oriented Programming!
In Python, almost everything is an object! (including lists, strings, integers, dictionaries and etc.)
With classes can create new kinds of objects and define their own methods and attributes.
Where attributes represent data about the object such as: name, colour, speed, size. And methods represent functionality or tasks associated with the objects, such as: drawing the object to the screen, changing its speed or size.
After you watch this - you'll be much more comfortable with using classes in your GUI projects 💪
So if you're ready to step up your programming game - this video is a great starting point! 😉

f0B6RdVGcM8,Python Simplified,Is Web Scraping Legal? My Take on Automation and Fair Use,"I got so many viewer comments asking me whether web scraping is legal or not so I thought it would be best to reply with a video! 🎥
Web Scraping is the practice of extracting information from websites with the use of code only. It is widely used for automation testing, marketing, HR, data science (generating databases) and many more!
And even though so many of us use web scraping on a daily basis - there are still many others claiming it's forbidden 🙃 

So who's right and who's wrong? Can you get in trouble for it? What is the difference between extracting the same information manually with your mouse and keyboard and programming a bot to scrape it instead?
Click play and find out what I think about it! 😉

In this step by step tutorial you will learn how to automate mass messaging on Linkedin! 😎😎😎
We will create a bot that will log in to our Linkedin account, find many of our contacts and send them whichever message we choose!

We will also learn how to bypass 3 types of blockers:
- blank elements
- inactive elements
- ""element not interactable"" exceptions

Especially when the price is $2,000 off!!! 🤩🤩🤩
Here's an update on the extraterrestrial beast I ended up getting, mostly from the value and savings perspective, but I'll make sure to film a benchmarks video as well (yes, I have Cyberpunk for that 😉).
If you're in the same situation as I was - checking out some pre-builts is a great way to go! and if you're checking in the right place - you might even find the computer of your dreams for the price of your dreams, just like me! 😁
In this video, I'll share my story and hopefully this might help some lovely people!

9iZLDnW_vwU,Python Simplified,Create GUI App with PyQt5 - PART 1,"In this video we'll use PyQt5 to create the graphic interface of ""Who Wants to be a Programmer???"";
a computer science trivia game, which determines who is truly worthy of the title!
We'll design the first two frames of this game and learn how to switch from one to the other effortlessly.
We'll also discuss in detail all the important widgets (text, image, button) , we'll go over styling and layout commands, as well as adding interactivity to clickable elements (this is probably my favourite part of PyQt5 - it allows you to create hover events and utilize your pro CSS skills to their full extent!).

This is PART 1 of the complete project, where we focus on creating the GUI.
In the upcoming PART 2, we will load a database of trivia questions and connect all its functionality to our interface.

mzbJd0NhW2A,Python Simplified,Build a Neural Network with Pytorch - PART 1,"In this lesson, I will demonstrate how to build your own neural network with Pytorch and word embedding!
This network is designed to create a story based-off several books that I've trained it on, and therefore I named it StoryTeller.
In this video, you will learn how to manually batch data, create a neural network class, and define the structure of your model.
I'll explain my trail of thought and the considerations when building such a model, and I'll also introduce you to Pytorch, which is a very powerful tool for Machine Learning and AI.
This is just an introduction, as I didn't include validation or pre-processing of our dataset, which are also very important steps that I've skipped to save some time (YES, it takes more than 35 minutes to build a proper model!) 
I highly recommend downloading/copying the starter notebook from my Google Drive, and proceeding to Part 2 of this lesson once you're done structuring your model.

GTyTG3XzPq8,Python Simplified,Train a Neural Network with Pytorch - PART 2,"In this part of the lesson, we'll learn how to define the training function for our model, as well as connecting to a GPU engine FOR FREE!
I've also included lots of helpful code inside the starter notebook to account for checkpoint saving, checkpoint loading, loss plotting, and prediction, so please make sure you copy/download it from the link below!
Even though the model is not nearly as accurate as it can be, we will test it at the end of the video and check how logical our predicted story is.
Feel free to experiment with different weights, batch size, embedding dimensions, linear transformations, activation functions, losses, optimizers and etc. as I'll be doing this on my end as well.
Once I reach a great accuracy with my StorryTeller, we'll go over this model in much more detail and tackle all the functions we didn't have a chance to build together (including validation and pre-processing).
In the meanwhile, you can use this code to troubleshoot your own models or build new models based-off the same principles and hopefully, this will give you a good idea about some of the processes involved in AI.

Honestly, I tend to get lazy and procrastinate a lot when working/ studying by myself. This iPad has helped me against procrastination because I actually think it is fun to use it. Even though it costs a lot of money (to me), I still think it's been a great investment overall.

Hey data nerds 👋, greetings from my hometown in Vietnam!! JupyterLab is a great tool for data science, but it has its own limitations.. big ones 😅.. Due to the fact that you can execute cells in different orders, it's easy to make mistakes and mess up the output. From my experience, it could be a big challenge to use JupyterLab in a complex data science project. In this video, I'm sharing with you about Link, a JupyterLab extension that helps us easily create pipelines in JupyterLab and share them with other people. This extension helps address the reproducibility issue of JupyterLab, and makes it easy to share results. While walking you through the how-to of this extension, I also tried to give a brief introduction to neural style transfer algorithm, which is what I implemented in this sample notebook. 

Let me know what you think about this extension and whether you would consider using it in your projects. Thank you for watching and have a great day! 🤗

Hey data nerds 👋, in this video we made an attempt to extract relationships between The Witcher's characters from the books. We also did some graph analyses (centrality measures and community detection) and visualization using NetworkX and Pyvis. The analyses are still quite preliminary and I might have glossed over some details, but hopefully, this is a bit interesting and you learned something from it 🤓. This is the second project in the Witcher project series where we will analyze the relationships between characters. The next episode of this series will be all about network graph visualization 😁. I hope you enjoyed this video and any questions and thoughts are welcome! Thank you for watching 🙌🏽

What's up, everyone! So today's video is a bit different from my normal talking-head/ tutorial style, attempting to teach you something about data science :). I've been thinking about making this video for a while, as I'm nearing the end of my study. As you probably noticed in some of my older videos I mentioned my BSc Computer Science study next to work, and that's what this video is all about :). I'm sharing here my story of how I came to do that, my motivation, strategies, and some fun demos of what I have created during my study. I hope you found this video entertaining and somewhat informative ;). And, don't forget to check out the nerdy gifts at the end of the video! ;) Thank you for watching!

jxzL3Pj3UVs,The PyCoach,How I Coded a Web App with ChatGPT (and Python),"I coded a web app that tracks Amazon prices using ChatGPT and Python and in this video, I’l show how to do all of this from scratch!
- Install flask: pip install flask
- Code: https://github.com/ifrankandrade/amazon-price-tracker/tree/main/amazon-price-tracker
- Scrape any website with ChatGPT (Tutorial): https://youtu.be/GapR6gIIHDs
- Exact prompt I used:  Create a web app using Flask. The app.py should have 2 main functions search and results. The search function will render a search HTML page. The results function will render a results HTML page with a list of products in data frame format that will be obtained by calling  the function extract_data that uses the inputs ""keyword"", and ""number of pages"" and also the ""current date"" (%Y%m%d%H) obtained from the datetime module. However if the user only introduces the input ""filter by price"" (min price, max price) and ""filter by name"" the products variable should read a CSV called price_change.csv and then use pandas to filter the price and name of the products. Note: The inputs ""keyword"", ""number of pages”, ""filter by price""  and ""filter by name"" are optional, so the use may introduce them or not

Throughout my entire childhood, much akin to other kids of my age, I was obsessed with video games.

The specific aspect of many games that I played that was triggering my addiction to playing them for hours and hours non-stop was this pursuit of leveling up, of ticking off higher and higher levels, and of trying to win ‘status’ in the in-game world by showing off your achievements.

Today, as an adult, I can see how this same frame of thinking applies to the real world, and the older I get the more I realize that the real world is in many ways a game. And specifically, it is the most exciting game in the world.

So that is why in today’s video I want to share to you the 4 principles that I am using to win the game of life.

Learning the Python programming language has probably been the single best decision I’ve ever made in my life.

Not only did it allow me to escape a career that I hated in finance and get an equally lucrative job doing something I actually enjoyed.

Software engineers, especially Python engineers are some of the best paid professionals in the world, in the big picture the demand for Python programmers will only keep going up and up and up. But to capitalize on this demand you need to understand a few things, which we’ll go over today.

But even besides my career, the more and more I learn about Python the more and more I discover insane and unexpected things that I can do to make my life easier and just have a ton of fun!

💡 Coding Was Hard Until I Changed THIS - https://youtu.be/_7uunAsvV9s

In 2021 when I sat down to start learning programming online for the very first time, I had no idea what I was doing.

I had all these doubts, how could I possibly do this on my own, I don’t even have a computer science degree, how can I compete, I’m not that good at math, how can I possibly learn to code.

And as we’ll discuss in this video, almost all of these fears which you might as well be feeling right now, were totally false, and frankly quite laughable.

But I didn’t know that at the time. And I’m not going to lie, if things had been even a bit different in my life at that time in the middle of 2021, I could have very easily given up.

You need a set of habits for how you go about your process of learning every day, that if cultivated for a very long period of time, it would be unreasonable for anyone to not be great at coding at the end of it. And from my own experience, from observing both myself and others trying to do the same, I think that there are 4 of these habits that I wish I knew so much earlier, that I want to present to you, my dearest viewer in this video.

A lot of these are really more like mindsets than necessarily habits, but I think this video right here might be the most valuable one I’ve ever made about learning to code, because I know that if you apply these to your life, you will not only be able to learn to code faster but achieve anything faster, because I today I apply all of these habits to all pursuits in my life.

There are 3 main challenges / obstacles that people usually would say having a degree is going to give you:

1. The obstacle of knowledge
2. The obstacle of structure
3. The obstacle of proof

So let’s go over each of these to understand what they are and if they actually are an issue, and if so how to mitigate them.

Consistency is king. Yet it is what most people learning to code struggle with.

Truth be told, I wasn’t always a productive person.

Tiktok, Instagram, Tinde..(krhm)

I’m just as familiar with these distractions as you are.

From school to university to teaching myself to code, no matter how many timetables I set for myself, or how many plans I made, eventually all of them ended up being scrapped.

So last year when I got to the point when I was teaching myself to code, working a part-time job, and making Youtube videos all at the same time, I figured that this was finally the time to learn to manage my time.

I remember when I started teaching myself to code exactly 537 days ago when I’m recording this, I saw all those videos “how I learned to code in 6 months”, I was like wow that guy must be so smart, or he must have just spent literally 16 hours per day working, I could never do that.

From the day I started writing code for the first time, it took me only 4 months to get my first job as a full-stack developer at a big company in London.

But there are still things even I wish I knew at the time when I started so I often ask myself, how would I learn to code and get a job if I were to start over from scratch.

So here are the 4 steps that you need to take and throughout this video, I will also share the 3 biggest mistakes I see beginners make when they’re learning to code including the biggest mistake I personally made. So make sure you watch this video all the way through to learn all of that.

Throughout this video, I am assuming that what you are optimizing for is simply getting a job as FAST as possible. If this is your goal, then keep watching.

I have been using a program called Notion to essentially manage my entire life for like the past 2 years now, everything from setting goals to book notes to just organizing my ideas and generally using it as a repository of information. 

And now that I’m a full-time software engineer I have found even more use cases for Notion to use for my programming projects, course notes, and a bunch of other stuff, so I thought I’d make this video to describe exactly how I use it and how a system like that could literally change your life as a software engineer, or someone learning to code, or just in general really.

So let’s say you’ve got a coding interview coming up in 14 days, and for some reason the interviewer decides to be a prick and says : 

“Btw you have to do this interview in Java”. 

But you’ve never coded in Java in your life!

So basically you’ve left with no other choice but to give up because obviously it’s impossible to learn an entire programming language in just 14 days....

WRONG!!

You can absolutely become decently competent in any programming language in just 12 days, and I know that because I did it myself in Java. So in this video, I will tell you exactly how you can do that too, including the principles I applied to learn efficiently, the resources I used, and some concluding thoughts around learning programming languages that might surprise you, so make sure you stick around.

This video isn’t about Java specifically, but I will be using my experience of learning Java as an example to help you learn any language you want to learn like Python, Javascript, or even the abomination of a language that is PHP.

Tech companies have not been doing too well recently. On the day before I’m filming this video, companies such as Microsoft, Google and Facebook all posted extremely disappointing earnings which lead their stock prices to absolutely plummet, from 7.7% cents for Microsoft, to 9% for Google to up to 30% for Facebook’s parent company Meta, which led their CEO Zuck to even admit that the company would face “near-term challenges on revenue”.

So if you’re someone who’s learning to code and wants to become a software engineer, you might justifiably be asking, what does this all mean for our careers? And do I actually need to care? I lean all I want to do is write code and make a lot of money doing it. Surely companies’ stock prices don’t even matter, right?

Well, unfortunately, this does matter for us. For example, according to data tracker layoffs.fyi, over 92,000 people have lost their jobs with headline after headline of tech companies firing people left right and center. 

This is because as the economy does worse, so do these companies, and hence they have less money to pay fat stacks to their software engineers.

And more broadly, with rampant inflation and much more, it seems inevitable that we’re all headed straight toward an economic recession.

But just how bad could this get for us programmers? What does this mean for the future of this career path that we’re all working so hard to build?

Have you ever looked at famous musicians or actors or chess players, and just marveled at the level of expertise and mastery that some people can express. If you’re like most people, you probably thought: wow, those people are so talented!

And while with fields like music there probably is talent involved as well, the real reason why Magnus Carlsen can recognize famous chess games from memory is not that he is somehow magically gifted. 

It is because of something else. And believe it or not, that something else is exactly the same thing that anyone who becomes a really good programmer has.

And it is exactly what you will learn to develop by watching this video, provided that you hit the like button of course!

And so throughout my now around a year of learning to code I have learned what this system is when it comes to learning coding concepts. It is broadly the same system I apply to learning anything, like for example right now I am learning a human language, German, using roughly these same steps, as I will show you at the end.

And the reason this works is that I have spent time learning how the human brain works by examining the results of decades of psychology and neuroscience to extract the most effective learning principles, and what I’ve learned is that learning is a skill in of itself.

People who learn don’t just happen to have high IQ or something, they simply, whether consciously or by accident, approach learning in the way that our brain was designed to learn, and literally anyone can do that!

Motivation is a myth. What you ACTUALLY need is discipline.

Most people ask ""how can I become more motivated to learn to code?"" But this is the wrong question to ask. What you really need to ask is ""How to become more disciplined to learn to code?""

Most people wait for motivation to take action. But what you actually need to do is become disciplined because the TRUTH about motivation is that you can never be motivated all the time when learning to code.

In this video I outline how I managed to build strong discipline and work hard even when I don't feel like it.

I also discuss how to tick your brain to make you WANT to code and work hard by making the process like a video game.

7 reasons why sowftware engineering is the best job in the world.

I recently started my first full-time job as a software engineer. And for me, choosing this job was anything but a shot in the dark.

You may have already heard my story, but prior to choosing this career, I spent a lot of time pondering and trying different industries and doing a lot of research on what would be the perfect career for me.

I tried working in banking, did not like it. I tried management consulting, which I didn’t mind, but it wasn’t quite the one for me.

And through all of these experiences and all this time I have learned a lot of things about what makes a great career.

And the only career that fulfils all of these points for me is software engineering/tech industry in general.

And based on all of this, here is why software engineering & working in the tech industry in general is the perfect job. For me. But also in general.

A lot of it is not what you think...

If I was a beginner, here's how I wish someone explained Data Structures to me so that I would ACTUALLy understand them.

MY PYTHON COURSE:
🚀 Python Programming Fundamentals Masterclass - https://superpeer.com/internetmadecoder/collection/python-programming-fundamentals-masterclass

MY DATA STRUCTURES & ALGORITHMS COURSE WILL BE HERE:
⚡️ Superpeer - https://superpeer.com/internetmadecoder

Data structures and algorithms are not most people's favourite coding concepts to learn. nevertheless, if you want to learn how to pass coding interviews, mastering data structures and algorithms is a must.

From linked lists to priority queues to graphs...when I was a beginner, I could not understand why these things are even important. What do data structures even mean and why do big tech companies ask these stupid leetcode-style questions in coding interviews?

But once I actually sat down and over a few months learned the theory and practice of data structures, I started to appreciate just how beautiful computer science can be.

In this video, I explain data structures for dummies and (hopefully) in a future video,  I will explain algorithms in a similar way!

If you don’t know which programming language to start with, the two that you should probably consider are Python and Javascript. There are 3 main reasons why:

1) how much demand there is in the job market, because let’s face it, you just want a job don’t you, 2) how easy they are to write and learn as a beginner with no prior experience and 3) how easy it is to build cool portfolio projects with them.

As a beginner, you want a language that allows you to build actual things that do something fast

Python:

Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.

Programmers usually love Python because its syntax is very English-like, meaning that it’s very intuitive and easy to read and write. Python was my first language actually so it holds a special place in my heart, and I remember thinking in the beginning that how can it be that I’m literally almost just writing English here and the computer can understand it.

Javascript:

JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.

It is often called the programing language of the web, as literally every web page in the world that is more than just static html and css, uses javascript.

You are probably making this ONE MISTAKE that means you may NEVER GET A JOB as a Software Engineer at a tech company.

If you are consistently making this one mistake by having the WRONG MINDSET, employers will not want to hire you. That is why it is a shame that most beginners do this one thing completely wrong which PREVENTS them from getting a job as a Software Developer.

I have experienced working internships in many industries from tech, consulting and banking and there is ONE TYPE OF PERSON that EVERY company in ANY industry looks for.

In this video, I tell you exactly what this type of person is so that you can get a job more easily and build an amazing career in tech.

I know you’ve seen those videos from other YouTubers where they go like ‘how I study for 12 hours a day with 100% focus’ and then when you can’t study for as long as them you feel bad and you get demotivated. 

But those people are 98% sure lying. Because if you actually look into our brain and how it works when it comes to knowledge work, you’ll realise  it’s actually impossible to actually study for 12 hours or anywhere close that. 

And if you learn to study smart and do actual good work, which is exactly what I will teach you in this video, you are going to be more productive than all those people attempting to study for 12 hours per day. Let me explain to you how.

That’s right, I want you to succeed in learning to code. But I am telling you to code less. And I’m not even one of those people saying ‘oh it’s fine to slow down, just take your time’, no, all the advice I give to you is geared towards achieving your goals as fast as possible. If you want to do it slow then go ahead, but what I am telling you is that to learn to code as fast as possible, you should NOT even try to study for any more than 4 hours a day, and even doing 1-2 hours of the right kind of work will get you more results than most people.

If you want to be a great software engineer, you can’t be writing bad code.

And if this topic of writing good, clean code seems like boring to you and something that’s not the sexiest thing to focus on I really understand that, I do. But writing good, clean code rather than filthy dirty, disgusting code, is just something you need to learn to do if you don’t want to be laugned at by your team and scorned at by your managers. Or shouted at by commenters if you post your coding projects on Youtube.

So here are 5 very easy steps you can start taking now to help you write like 80% better code which will literally put you above 95% of beginners who never bother to learn any of this stuff.

First, we need to understand what good code even means.

Code is clean if it can be understood easily – by everyone, not just yourself. The key thing you need to understand is that the goal of code, especially in the context of larger companies where it’s not just you working on your dumb Python script, is that it not only does the job but is also easy to understand and modify by others.

This is all something that I’ve now learned myself while currently researching this and focusing on implementing this over the past few weeks. I can tell that it makes a big difference when I go back to my own programs to debug them or change them or whatever, half the time I have literally no idea what I was even trying to do when I wrote the program the first time and that is no good.

⚡️ Superpeer - https://superpeer.com/internetmadecoder

When you’re learning to code or generally trying to achieve anything it’s crucial to manage your time and actually have a plan each day. 

I’ve been practising something called deep work for a long time, which essentially just means blocking out time for uninterrupted work on a specific task

but I realised that I never really actually know how long or when I spend time on all my projects and goals.

So that is why I decided to build a Python script to track my time for me to allow me to analyze my schedule, make better decisions and eventually build an entire engine to allocate my time in the most optimal way.

In this video, you will learn to do exactly this too step by step, so if you appreciate that, tap the like button down below, and before we get into the tutorial!

And I know those comments are made with the best of intentions, but in a certain way they actually frustrate me, because one of the biggest things I want to get across with this channel is that ANYONE can do it, I’m not special, I’m really not, I’m just a regular guy who happened to figure out the right principles at the right time and it’s these pretty simple principles that allowed me to learn to code fast and also get a job.

These principles are ridiculously simple, which is why it’s even more frustrating to me that no one teaches these things at school for example, these are very elementary things based on your brain chemistry, your neurobiology, that if you simply realise and internalise you can apply them INSTANTLY.

There are 4 principles that I will be sharing in this video, and I’ve left the most important one for last so make sure you watch this video all the way through because that way you’ll get the most value out of this....

AI is probably the most mysterious, fascinating,and to many, scariest, branch of computer science. Starting today, I plan to teach myself artificial intelligence and machine learning using MOOCs and other online resources.

To do this, I am going to be utilising my own 5-step process that I efficiently use to master any field or concept that I want to learn.

I am especially interested in Deep Learning, a subarea of Machine Learning based on reinforcement learning.

You might not know this, but you actually interact with deep learning algorithms every day.

The reason why you’re addicted to tiktok is because Tiktok’s machine learning algorithm knows precisely the types of videos it should feed you to keep you on the platform.

And how do they know this? It’s certainky not because there is some human sitting and quessing what videos to show you next, no, it is because by giving Tiktok’s clever machine learning algorithms a bunch of previous data of what you’ve watched and kept watching in the past it can figure out what has worked before and keep you giving more and more and more of that content and the more you watch the better it gets at this.

So because ML is a subarea of AI, I figured that the most logocal approach is to first study a general course on ai and then use more specialised resources to go deeper into ml including itsmost powerful manifestation, deep learning

1-RfYZ864xI,Internet Made Coder,How I Learned to THINK LIKE A PROGRAMMER,"Learn to think like a programmer. Develop a programmer's mindset.;

If I were to give ONE piece of advice to any beginner,  anyone who wants to learn to code, it would be to learn to think like a programmer.

I have studied what the best programmers and problem solvers in the world say about this and here’s what I’ve learned

So in this video, I will give you a step-by-step process to solve any coding problrm and become a master programmer.

A common misconception that people have about programmers is that they know everything. But, in reality, that's not quite the case. What programmers do have is a unique approach to solving problems and, in this video, we’ll explore what that programmer mentality is all about.

when you’re programming, you’re trying to communicate with a machine. Which is very different from talking to a human. Just like when talking to people who speak a different language, in order to communicate, you’ll have to speak the language of who you’re speaking to.

And in the case of machines, that language is the language of logic.

But the benefits of learning the language of logic go beyond just programming…

Programmers are strictly analytical and think using precise logic and leave elotions copletely out of the equation. When you have your programmer hat on, you’re a complete logical machine. You don’t get mad, you just solve problems.

All your computer actually understand is zeros and ones, ie binary. What actually happens is when you run your code, it is actually secretly passed into another program called the compiler that turns your code into machine code. This machine code is then passed and transformed repeatedly until finally it is converted into binary.

Even I don’t know all the intricate details about how all of this works, and that’s the way it’s supposed to be. This showcases a fundamental philosophy of coding.

This is about embracing top-down learning - build first, then dive into the theory and the details if and when you need to. this used to be very uncomfortable for me, but that’s okay, I just had to train myself to be okay with not knowing everything because honestly I never will and that is simply the nature of this field.

K2OeKGd8HCo,Internet Made Coder,I Was Learning to Code WRONG - Don't Make This Mistake..,"How I changed how I approach learning new programming concepts.

If you want to learn programming, it is crucial to have the right study methods and strategies. I am still discovering this myself, and while I was learning a new complex computer science concept, I discovered a new mindset to learning coding that is completely transforming my learning system. 

It is so simple that I cannot believe I was doing this wrong and making the way I learn to code less effective.

In addition, I think most people in the world learn things in reverse order by focusing on the wrong things first. This video shows you how to fix that using top-down learning. 

Recent research in cognitive neuroscience has shown how a top-down approach enhances the learning process by stimulating areas of the brain that contain existing knowledge.

rwWCyXYwPhA,Internet Made Coder,How I Would Learn Python FAST in 2023 (from zero),"Here is how to learn Python FAST

1. Choose the right beginner course. I’ll be the first to say that just doing courses and watching tutorials online isn’t what’s going to properly teach you to code, however, at the very start you do need to start with some introductory course to get the fundamentals down

The one I always recommend for Python specifically is Zero to Mastery’s Python online bootcamp, this is the most complete Python course that I’ve seen online, let me know if you’ve seen something better but this is the one I would do if I was starting over.

It starts off from the very basics so if you’ve never coded at all before, or never written a line of Python, this course starts from the beginning just like most courses, but the thing is it actually goes all the way to very advanced concepts, to the point that even I learned a whole bunch from the second half of the course even though I already knew Python pretty well when I started doing this for my review.

So I would suggest starting with this course, you should aim to complete it in maybe 2-4 weeks depending on how busy you are, it doesn’t really matter, but it’s key to set yourself some sort of learning goal, let’s say one hour every day, at the VERY least because otherwise you just won’t end up sticking to it, that’s just how we are as humans, so building the habit of doing some lessons + the exercises every day is absolutely crucial.

2. Practice every day.

Set an hourly goal per day based on your ambition level.

I’m considering having a fully detailed video coming up on how many hours I code a day + how to actually get in more hours per day very soon, so stay tuned!

3. Study smart as well as hard to maximise your time. I made a more detailed video on this right here, but the idea is that there are actual, fundamental science-backed ways in which you can actually be more efficient with your time to the point that you could get done in one hour what someone else might do in 3 hours if you know what you’re doing. To achieve this, the most important thing is to make a habit of practising deep work.

Watch till the end for the most important step!!

Okay, so I talk about learning to code all the time on this channel. But in this video, instead of the HOW, we’re going to talk about the WHY.

There are 3 main dimensions of reasons why you should learn to code.

1. It can make you very rich. And I don’t just mean the fact that software engineers get paid a lot. Being a well-paid developer is not even the best opportunity you have with this skill, as we will discuss in the video.

2. You can teach computers to help you. Unlike other skills like Powerpoint that are only useful as a career; coding can help you even if you never even intend to do it as a career

3. it’s intellectually stimulating (Problem-solving and logical thinking). If you like problem solving, this is the purest form of problem solving

Learning any skill really well takes a lot of time and it’s usually better to focus on mastering one thing rather than spreading your attention across many facets and never actually properly learning any of them.

There are many skills you could focus your attention on like painting, graphic design, and photography, and while they all have their merits, coding stands out for me because it uniquely answers what the world demands in this day and age, which in turn puts you in a position to demand a lot of money in return for having that skill.

1. The basic building blocks of Python so that you can get started learning Python
2. The concepts that you will need to master in order to become a proficient Python programmer
3. A list of courses and resources at the end that I recommend so that you will know exactly where to go next

But before all of this, let’s briefly discuss why Python is such a great language to learn.

There are 4 main reasons why I’ve personally switched to using Python as the main programming language that I use the most.

1. The applications.
2. The syntax.
3. The libraries.
4. the demand.


What we will discuss in this video:

I’ll try to focus on the big picture and the basics so that you can start to get an understanding of how Python, and more generally, how a programming language works. I’ll focus on trying to explain this in a way that is as easy to understand as possible.

Thanks to Masterworks for sponsoring today's video!

Here’s the TRUTH about how I taught myself to code in 4 months and got a job as a software engineer.

By far the most popular video on this channel is my ‘How I learned to code in 4 months and got a job offer as a software engineer video’, now at almost 1 million views which is just absolutely insane to me.

And I realise that that video was just a very broad overview of WHAT I did, which courses I took etc, but I didn’t go very deep into the HOW of how I learned to code, so in this video I want to do just that.

I’ve identified 3 factors that contributed to me being able to learn so fast

1. First, I worked really hard. There's no shortcut to this. If you want to get good at coding, you need to put in a lot of hours. I was in a position where I was taking a gap year, so with no other responsibilities, I was able to put in those hours in a relatively small amount of actual months, so that's really why I was able to do it in 4 rather than say 12 months like most people do. But we'll talk about exactly how many hours I put in per day etc.

2. Second is luck. I openly admit on my video that especially how I actually got my Software Engineer job offer was pretty lucky. Any success in life requires some luck. But the key is to not focus on that. As I do also believe I made my own luck, so we'll talk about that too.

3. And thirdly, I think I focused on the right things. And this is absolutely key, and a lot what I share on this channel is about focusing on the right things, working smart etc. While I did work hard I put in less hours than I could have had I not spent the time upfront figuring out what  is most important and organising my studies intelligently, so we'll talk about that as well.

And that’s what automating your life with Python allows you to do, so in this video I will show you how to get started with learning to teach your computer to do the boring and menial tasks you do every day, and we’re going to be doing that via a simple project to automatically organise your computer’s downloads folder.

You might ask, do I need to use Python, and if so why Python?If I know C, Java or Javascript, can I use those to automate my life? And yes, you probably can use other languages, the reason why Python is usually used for these types of applications is that it's easy to learn, has an active community, and has tons of libraries to cover many automation needs.

In addition it’s very simple to write and understand and sort of does a lot for you so you don’t need to worry about low level details like memory management or types for example.

The only downside of Python is that it’s much slower than something like C, but for these simple automation scripts that doesn’t really matter.

But yes, you can probably use other languages, you just need to check that the language has the ability to touch your computer’s file system for example.

I do recommend using Python. It’s a very nice and sleek language.

People underestimate the power of systems. It seems like this abstract thing, like ‘productivity system’, what does that even really mean. And the second thing that probably comes to mind with this idea of systems, especially if you’ve seen many other productivity videos here on YouTube is that it’s all about finding the best app, or the best tool which will just magically make you more productive.

And tools are important, and in fact, I am a bit of a nerd when it comes to gear and apps and all that, and in this video, I will show you all the apps and tools I use that help me be more productive and learn more effectively, but the truth is that no app or piece of gear can fix a broken system.

So what I really want to share with you is the set of mindsets, methods and strategies that I have implemented over the years, first in university and now teaching myself coding and computer science, and as a YouTuber (can I call myself that yet?). As well as how I combine all of these things together into one cohesive system that is then aided by all the tools and apps I use.

Tell me if this has ever happened to you:

You want to learn something new like, coding, or start some new project. You’re really excited about it and for the first few days everything is going great. But then something happens…you no longer have the motivation that you had initially and you always just end up going to watch Netflix instead. You get stuck and you never seem to be able to actually finish.

Well, I wouldn’t know anything about that because I am a productivity guru, and us gurus, we never procrastinate!

…yeah that’s definitely a lie. It happens to me all the time too…

But throughout the years, being someone who wants to do & achieve a lot, I’ve slowly but surely learned how to tackle that feeling of demotivation and push through.

So, you want to know how I am able to stay motivated to learn to code all day, every day?

The truth is: I don’t stay motivated. But I do it anyway.

Information is exchanged today more than ever, and the wrong information in the hands of a malicious or hostile person can cause incredible damage. This is Why Cyber Security & protecting yourself online is super important.

If you really think about it, the thing that you’re most afraid of that could damage you more than anything else is not physical weapons but rather the wrong numbers and words connected to the wrong contexts in the hands of the wrong people at the wrong time and place. Yet you probably enter those words and numbers on your computer or phone all the time, just hoping that they don’t end up in the wrong place.

But there are more ways than you can imagine in which all of this could go terribly wrong for you, if you don’t know hat to look out for. And that is what this video is about.

You need to learn to protect yourself online, how to create strong passwords for internet security, and not be spied on by the bald buy at the corner of your coffee shop!

When you’re online there is always an element of trust. Who do you trust to know stuff about you? you can never know for sure that you are trusting the right parties, and other than not using the internet at all, there is no such thing as absolute security, but with the tips in this video, you can get one step closer!

eiQzzMt-J3Y,Internet Made Coder,How I'm Studying Data Structures & Algorithms (as self taught),"How to pass coding interviews? learn Data Structures and Algorithms. But people forget that they are also fundamental computer science topics that you need to master if you want to have a fundamental understanding of how computers work and how to solve problems using them.

DATA STRUCTURES & ALGORITHMS RESOURCES MENTIONED:
🧠 Zero to Mastery's Data Structures & Algorithms course -  https://academy.zerotomastery.io/a/aff_nqb6sg6w/external?affcode=441520_vhlt5jy9
💻 Leetcode - https://leetcode.com/
📕 Sedgewick's Algorithms textbook - https://amzn.to/3DMSBfR
📹 Algorithms Coursera Course - https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1?

That is why it is such a shame to see so many people approach this topic by just memorising Leetcode problems rather than taking the time to learn the fundamentals.

Sure, that approach can work to pass an interview (with some luck) but it's an inefficient long-term strategy.

You might call that a very inefficient DSA study algorithm…;)

So my approach for studying Data Structures & Algorithms is really focused on taking my time to properly understand these topics, in fact I'm probably going way deeper than I actually need to. But I'm of the belief that more knowledge can never hurt.

Note: This is simply what I am doing, which may or may not be the 'best' DSA study algorithm.

If your goal is to pass an interview, doing a LOT of problems is a must. But what people often skip is parts 1 and 2 which will give you some of the foundational knowledge that will give you a shortcut to having a better idea of the types of things you need to consider when solving Leetcode problems.

Project Mentioned: (Hosted by Hostinger): http://financialfreedomvisualizer.com/

When I was in university, I was a serial procrastinator. I am the type of person who wants to be really good at what I do but for some reason, I just couldn’t push myself to do that with my university degree, and I feel like this is a common problem people have (you aren’t procrastinating right now while reading this, are you?).
My university degree was in Economics, but after graduating I did a complete U-turn and decided to teach myself how to code and get a job as a software developer instead of working in Economics or Finance like most of my peers.

So when I started learning to code, I was facing a lot of the same problems. I was “learning” but I wasn’t really learning. For a long time, I was really concerned that I could never force myself to learn to code well enough to become a good developer and get a job.

But then something started changing. I came to a realisation that would drastically change my learning strategy and end up allowing me to finally acquire the things I was learning rather than just shallowly learn & then forget them 2 weeks later. I came upon this change in strategy by accident, and in hindsight, it seems so obvious that I cannot even believe didn’t realise it earlier.

JwRsn2VYzmQ,Internet Made Coder,"How I Study SMARTER, Not HARDER (my secret hacks)","💡 Imagine if you could learn things 10x faster than you can now. What would that mean for you? What would that allow you to do?

When learning to code, it's critical to use the best study methods to learn as fast as possible so that you can learn more and/or just have more free time, and a better work-life balance.

I don't know if the tips in this video will help you learn 10x faster, or just 2x faster, but I guarantee that if you apply my 5 best productivity tips for students & programmers, you will be able to be more productive and learn things faster.

First, I use the 5-minute rule to stop procrastination. Learning how to not procrastinate is crucial to allow you to get things done more effectively.

Second, I use time-blocking and other productivity hacks to help me reach the flow state. The flow state, also known colloquially as being in the zone, is the mental state in which a person performing some activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity. This is critical to be more productive.

Third, I use a to-do app as my personal knowledge management system. This way, all my tasks are stored in the app and I don't need to use my brain to remember them.

Fourth, I set Artificial Deadlines. Does this sound familiar: You have an essay due in a month. You make minimal progress until a day before the deadline, then cram the entire thing on the last day with the power of coffee and energy drinks.You can impose artificial deadlines on yourself, meaning that you act as if your project/essay is due, for example, a week earlier than it actually is. This way, you are creating urgency for yourself and your mind will be more likely to find a way to get things done early and leave you with a bunch of extra time, free from the burden of having that project still be unfinished.

Lastly, try to enjoy the process. Because if you don't, where's the point anyway :).

DESCRIPTION
On one hand, it is true that for 90% of a programmer’s job, you’re not going to be using any mathematics at all beyond basic arithmetic. But on the other hand, many people rightly point out that programming is simply a subset of computer science, which itself is a subset of mathematics. So how could it possibly be that math is not needed for programming?

I understand both arguments. I believe both of them are right, so in this video, I will give my best shot at reconciling them. My conclusion is that while in many applications of programming you won’t need that much math, you should still learn it.

But more important than that conclusion is how I get there. At the end, I also give my recommendation on a free resource to teach you all the math you need for computer science.

Asking “Do you need math for programming?” doesn’t really make sense as a question without some context. It all depends on what you want to create. If all you want to make is a simple website with HTML, CSS and Javascript, you won’t need to know a single thing about matrix algebra or how to find a topological sort of a finite directed acyclic graph.
So if you know for a fact that you’ll only be performing simple tasks like that in your career, there you go. You probably won’t need to know any advanced math.

But I will argue that even if that is the case, you should probably still learn some maths that is used in computer science & I will give 4 concrete reasons why.

WHO AM I?
This channel documents my life as a Self-Taught Software Engineer as well as my journey teaching myself Computer Science & Programming. When I graduated from university in July 2021, I was still completely lost as to what I really wanted to do. I always had an interest in technology, so I decided to start learning how to code with zero experience, and it quickly became my passion. After just 4 months of learning programming on my own, I had a job offer, and I will begin my career as a software engineer in September 2022.

EJlPIfNSFH8,Internet Made Coder,CS50’s Web Programming Course FULL REVIEW,"CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript Course Review

If you have been following this blog and/or my Youtube channel, you know how big a fan I am of CS50’s original course — Introduction to Computer Science.

CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript - https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-web-programming-python-and-javascript?delta=0
CS50's Introduction to Computer Science - https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x

After finishing that course, to my delight, I saw that they have many other follow-up courses such as their CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python as well as this one, CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript, which is the topic of this review.

Just like the previous course, CS50 Web is divided into 8 “weeks” (I like to think of these as just ‘sections’, as you can spend any time you want with each), each consisting of a roughly 2-hour video lecture, accompanying lecture notes as well as a project which applies the contents learned in that week’s materials.

As you’ll see, this time the projects are much more substantial than the original CS50’s problem sets.

This is also the biggest difference compared to the original CS50. The projects are much more involved and difficult, often taking me several days each to complete. But I think this is actually a very good thing, for several reasons which I will discuss a bit later.

You’ll essentially learn how to build full web applications on your own using the Django Python framework. In fact, you’ll already build several of these during the course.

To my initial disappointment, another difference from CS50 is that CS50 Web is not taught by the renowned David Malan, but instead by CS50’s assistant teacher Brian Yu.

This disappointment was quickly forgotten as I got used to Brian’s equally engaging and intuitive teaching style. Just like David, he explains concepts extremely clearly and in a way that makes you genuinely excited about the topics.

Sv8ZDQFTdBE,Internet Made Coder,How Much Software Engineers Make Across the World (Tech salaries by country),"Software Engineer Salaries. How much software developers make in USA, UK, India, Germany, Australia and Switzerland.

In this video, I’m going to break down as best as possible how much do software engineers REALLY make. Because this can be a very confusing topic. On one hand, you have people who are sharing absurdly high salaries like 400k+ at top tech companies, which often leads many people to assume that that is what you will actually make if you become a software engineer.

Cost of Living numbers: https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/

Salary numbers: https://www.levels.fyi

This topic is important for two reasons

1. Let’s face it, we all like money. It isn’t everything but given the chance you’d probabli like to make more. So it’s important that you can have realistic expectations and make informed decisions about your career.

2. it’s important to know your worth

What people don’t consider is that your compensation highly depends on your location, your company and your experience level. Most of the ‘how much software engineers make’ videos on Youtube tend to focus on a single country, usually the USA, and/or a single type of company (usually FAANG).

So because I have a very international audience, and because I’m very interested in the topic of how much do software engineers actually make in different locations, in different companies at different levels, I decided to completely break down based on all the data I could find, software engineer salaries in a few major countries, and give you the median entry-level salary, median salary across all levels, median salary at big tech companies (I use google as a proxy), and the median salary for a big tech company with a few years of experience

As a general rule, software engineers get paid really well. I think in pretty much every location I looked at, the salary for software engineers is much higher than the general median salary across all industries. And there are many reasons why, if you want a more detailed economic explanation on why software engineers get paid so well, you can watch this video where I really break it down in more detail, but the general gist of it is that the world today is dominated by technology, every new product. service pretty much is in some way or another related to technology, and all these companies who create new technology need software engineers to make it for them. So the demand for coding skills is extremely high, and because coding takes time to learn, it’s not like anyone can become a software engineer, so there simply isn't enough supply to meet all the demand, so companies are forced to pay above-average salaries for software engineers.

The Odin Project (resource mentioned)
https://www.theodinproject.com/paths

Python vs Java vs Javascript vs C++

In this video, I WILL give you an answer to that!

If you’re new to programming, the first question burning in your mind is probably:

“Which programming language should I learn first?”

or

“Which programming language is the best?”

Firstly I want to say that I actually hate both of these questions (especially the second one). I think they are the wrong questions to ask. Anyone with a little bit of experience programming will know that what language you choose first isn’t nearly as important as understanding the underlying logic of programming which is more or less the same across all languages.

When to use a for loop, how to use variables, when to use recursion..these are the types of concepts you’ll have to understand as a programmer — no matter which language! And if you understand them in one language, knowing how to use them in another reduces to the trivial matter of finding the correct syntax.

But with all that being said, I do in fact think that asking the question of ‘which language to learn’ is in fact reasonable.

The last disclaimer I will make is that the language you choose will depend on your goals.
-To learn Computer Science fundamentals, you should probably go with a low-level language like C (in fact, if you are pursuing a CS degree, this choice will be made for you anyway so the question is redundant)
-For Machine Learning & Data Science stuff, you should probably go with Python because it’s the industry standard
-I know nothing about game development, but I hear they use mostly C++

HOWEVER, if you are like most people, you probably want to learn to program because you just want to get a job as fast as possible and/or you’re just first delving into the world of tech with no specific goal other than ‘learning to code’.

And for these people, ie for most people in most cases, I do think there is one language that is actually the “best” one to start with

So then what is that magical language you ask?…(drumroll…)

Watch the video to find out ;)

CS50 FULL REVIEW - Best Course to Learn Computer Science in 2022? (edX, Harvard)
https://youtu.be/-Zj1kepwRuw

//

I talk about the theory of how to study effectively, as well as how to NOT study effectively, then I will dive into the specifics of each of my science-backed principles that my whole system is based on and for each one I will show how I use Notion to actually implement it and why Notion is so great for it.

Big picture is that you need to focus on understanding, not memorizing.

How to learn things fast according to science:

Active recall:

We don’t learn by putting stuff into our brains, we actually learn when taking things out of it. It has been shown that the process of trying to retrieve information from your brain actively reinforces the connections in your brain and just makes you retain that information much better. How your brain works is that it’s trying to choose between what information is important and what is not, and strengthening the information that is important.

Feynman technique:

Type notes not by looking at the lecture notes, but by thinking ‘how would I explain this so someone else’. Especially for math, how would I intuitively explain this simply without jargon or definitions to someone not familiar with the topic (6th grader). Simplify as much as you can.

Spaced repetition:

Space repetition is about ‘reminding’ you rbrain that something is important so the brain doesn’t default to forgetting it which it will do if you don’t constantly bring it back to re-strengthen those connections.

With all of this, you still need to show up every day and do the work. I know this & motivating yourself to get things done is something many people struggle with especially related to self-studying anything like coding which can be a very solitary process. There are quite a few things I do that makes all of this very easy for me so let me down in the comments if making a video on that is something that would be interesting to you, because I’d be more than happy to share that.

7:40 How I got a job

Just a few months ago, I had no idea what coding even was. All I knew was that it had something to do with typing complicated stuff on a computer. I got the idea of  learning how to code after I graduated with an Economics Degree from a university in London. Economics is a highly valued degree, most people who do it in top universities like mine become investment bankers and stuff like that. I did an internship at a big bank too, but I hated it. So I started looking into what career path could give me a lot of money, and also a great work-life balance. So I discovered, software engineering.

I learned that to become a software engineer, all you really need is to know how to code. So I typed on Google, how to learn to code, and I ended up starting with Python for Everybody and the Odin Project, these are both free resources, the former introduced me to one of the most popular programming languages of today, Python, and the latter familiarized me with the basics of Web Development using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

At this point my goal was just to get a vague sense of the vast world of programming, to start understanding what was out there, how the different pieces like front-end and backend development fit together and what they mean at a high level. Going through the Odin Project I got a basic sense for many interesting topics such as how the internet works and what it actually means to open a web page on your browser.

I will also tell you how I got my first job in tech as a Software Engineer..

What is CS50?

CS50x is Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming for majors and non-majors alike, with or without prior programming experience. An entry-level course taught by David J. Malan, CS50x teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. The on-campus version of CS50x , CS50, is Harvard's largest course.

Students who earn a satisfactory score on 9 problem sets (i.e., programming assignments) and a final project are eligible for a certificate. This is a self-paced course–you may take CS50x on your own schedule.

YotbvhndSf4,Kimberly Fessel,Clear Example of Jaccard Similarity // Visual Explanation of What is the Jaccard Index?,"See a clear example of Jaccard similarity, also called the Jaccard index, in this tutorial video.  I begin by demonstrating a visual example with a grocery shopping trip and sharing the definition of Jaccard similarity.  We see the Jaccard similarity formula and use it to compute the Jaccard index between our two sets: the grocery list vs the grocery purchases.  Then we explore two other example applications.  First, we calculated the Jaccard similarity for two text documents.  And we will answer, ""What is Jaccard similarity"" in the context of text NLP.  Next, we see an application of the Jaccard index in data science, specifically, Jaccard similarity machine learning for a binary classification problem.  We see that the Jaccard coefficient is defined for the positive class, and we also use the Jaccard similarity confusion matrix definition.

Eg0NJcUWLRM,Kimberly Fessel,"Advanced Seaborn Color Palettes | Cubehelix palette, xkcd colors, choose_colorbrewer_palette","Learn advanced seaborn color palette options in this tutorial video.  We begin with the seaborn cubehelix palette.  I answer what is cubehelix and show you various options like cubehelix start, rotation, light, and dark.  We then move on to more seaborn palette options, specifically the seaborn husl palette.  This palette is based off of the HSL color system, and I show you how to use the arguments hue, saturation, and lightness to make your own seaborn palette custom.  Up next we have the seaborn xkcd palette, which accepts color names from the xkcd color survey results.  You can pass a list of xkcd colors to this seaborn function.  I also show you how to use seaborn's crayon palette, which accepts standard Crayola crayon color names, and we also look at the seaborn color palette function to build a seaborn palette with many colors based off of HTML hex color codes.  This allows you to use seaborn color palette hex colors.  Finally, we close by examining seaborn's color palette widgets.  For starters, I show you how to use seaborn choose colorbrewer palette to make your own custom palette from the widget.  I also demonstrate how to use that seaborn palette in a scatterplot, and how if your seaborn color palette is not working, you may not have the right number of colors in your palette.  Last, we see seaborn choose cubehelix palette to make a cubehelix palette with the seaborn widget.

I start from the basics and show you how to add another y axis with the matplotlib twinx axes method.  I explain that you should consider matplotlib two y axes if your data are on two different scales.  Then we learn how to use ax twinx, which creates a new set of subplot axes with an invisible x-axis but an independent y axis on the opposite side.  I them demonstrate how you can color code your matplotlib secondary y axis ticks and label to make your visual more clear.  I also show you code for creating a matplotlib secondary y axis legend, both as separate legends for each axis and as one ax twinx legend.  I then walk you through an example of creating a seaborn secondary y axis, which means you can have seaborn two y axes as well also using plt twinx.  Finally, I conclude by showing visuals of a matplotlib figure with three y axes and a matplotlib secondary x-axis using matplotlib twiny.

First we talk about what the clustermap is: a matrix plot with a heatmap and two clustering dendrograms.  Next I walk you through some basic clustermap code for a toy data set so that you can understand what the clustermap does.  I then explain the algorithm behind the clustermap: hierarchical agglomerative clustering.  We discuss how the clustermap algorithm works and how it makes a dendrogram.  Then I show you how to build a clustermap for more advanced data and how you can use the seaborn clustermap standard_scale to scale your columns.  Then we move on to two important parameters: the distance metric and the linkage.  I walk you through what each of these are with example visuals, and we also see these in the seaborn clustermap code as the metric and method keyword arguments. Finally, I show you how to use the seaborn clustermap row_colors option to tag your rows by color based on a categorical column of your dataset.

Released in Seaborn 0.11.0, the displot is an updated form of the distplot. I begin by explaining the similarities and differences between these two, and then I demo the Seaborn code basics of the displot.  We make a histogram, KDE plot, and an ECDF plot.  I also add a rug plot to these figures.  Next, I show you a new option: plotting the distributions of two variables with the displot.  This is the bivariate or 2D Seaborn displot.  We then walk through examples of leveraging the Seaborn FacetGrid within the displot, and I show you how to make rows or columns of figures.  Finally, we explore styling the displot  by passing keywords to the displot, to the underlying histplot or kdeplot, and to the underlying FacetGrid.  Hope you enjoy seeing the excellent new updates to the Seaborn distribution plot and comparing the displot vs distplot!

For the final example, I show you how to loop through a list of values and annotate a bar plot with text based on a variable.

I first introduce you to what the catplot is and then I show you the basics on how to code a Seaborn catplot.  I demo you how you can create different Seaborn category plots with the catplot by referencing the catplot kind argument including the strip plot, boxplot, and violin plot.  I also show you how to use the Seaborn catplot hue argument.  Next I explain how to leverage catplot's underlying FacetGrid to create small multiples from categorical variables.  The catplot FacetGrid allows you to create rows and/or columns of small figures all at once!  I also demo how you can sort the catplot FacetGrid using the row and column order arguments.  Finally, we end by checking the  catplot style options including how to set the Seaborn catplot title using FacetGrid methods.
