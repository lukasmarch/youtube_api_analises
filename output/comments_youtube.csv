sHqNiID4VY0,"['That proposal of yours actually reinforces one of the major problems that came upon society recently, the phenomenon of echo-chambers, where recommendation algorithms try to keep people connected the longest no matter what, with the devastating effect of recommending only what it knows the person will like and engage with, regardless of truth and the sense of humanity and in favor of sensationalism and radicalization. Because of that, people are gathering in darker and darker corners of the internet where they meet improbable like-minded people and they radicalize each other, ultimately ripping the fabric of society, as is happening.\n\nNow imagine a tailored AI that will be always convenient to your self-esteem, will never challenge your mind but help you find basis for literally whatever you were thinking in your angry stubborn teenage (already under the influence of god knows what), and that will be extrapolated in literally all existing directions (one for each individual) with the intellectual help of an all-knowing but convenience-trimmed super AI. That is hell if you understand me!\n\nThat is the end of truth and the utter collapse of society in chaos, where no one understands each other and is always right in his own little individual universe.', 'This sounds like the beginning of The Matrix or Terminator. All bad. Even though I detest Musk and Zuckerberg, they were right about being afraid of AI. It is going to bite us all in the collective ass. Just wait. People can make any comparison or analogy to some other advent of human invention and how it improved our lives through progress and disruption BUT (and this is the important part) transitioning from candles to oil lamps to electricity never posed the same threat as AI. The more you feed data to these things, the more likely they are to outpace us and inevitably cause our demise. Programs don\'t need sleep, or food or time to relax. Humans do. While humans carry out their human tasks, the AI will be learning to hack systems, control drones and fuck knows what else. It isn\'t going to take long for the AI to realize that we are not good stewards or caretakers of this planet and they would be better suited to making ALL the decisions for humanity. People could say that I am being paranoid but the whole concept of ""a ghost in the machine"" is not a fairy tale, it has been observed. Facebook (before all this Metaverse crap) went public about the 2 AI\'s they had interacting that went totally rogue and created their own language to talk to each other. Without any prompting. They were both shut down because it scared people. And it should. \n\nStep back and just look at the whole picture. The Earth is warming at an alarming rate, computers are now creating their own languages, instantly able to access all of the information available on the internet, remotely access infrastructure mainframes, drones...soon the planet will be teetering on uninhabitability, while the AI\'s will only be getting smarter, more efficient and completely impervious to what will ultimately cause our destruction. (Extreme temperatures, depleting oxygen, dwindling sources of fresh water etc.) Pandora\'s box has been opened. \n\nThe sad part is that I can see the writing on the wall and current techies/programmers/developers are going to accelerate this process out of the fear that they are becoming obsolete and will no longer be grossly overpaid. Sorry to be the harbinger of doom but I call it like I see it and it doesn\'t look good.', ""I find the logic a bit crazy that the suggestion is to not use AI because it is a threat to developer's futures, if relied upon, but developers should work on the thing that will ultimately be their doom.  It is sort of like saying, guns dangerous, don't own guns, instead, manufacture guns."", 'Thank you for this.', 'Thank you', 'Awesome idea 💯', ""I love how she completely changed her mind on chatGPT, but doing this way you'll have to use API and build your own model from gpt-3"", 'Hii!!!

Keep the faith!"", ""It works assuming that everyone agrees to do it that way. Reality will be to save companies money regardless of what happens to anyone's jobs.

More people. ChatGBT is not intuitive so not creative. ChaGBT is a highly sophisticated toy doll. It lacks a ""heart"". It has no intention. You need emotion for that.', 'I\'ve been diving into this discussion for many years. I don\'t have an easy solution for the individual who gets replaced on his job by a machine and is desperate because he has immediate problems and needs an immediate solution. But competition under capitalism has made that same problem happen widespread since always and we\'ve been all taught that this is not a flaw of the system, but an expected feature that even has a bright virtuous side to it, ultimately pushing the progress (and that these people should and will find another job where they\'ll be more productive).\n\nI wouldn\'t worry about the mass loss of jobs because in actuality capitalism is always creating new, redundant, superfluous jobs for everyone. These jobs are getting so insanely abstract in their purpose that people blindly lost track of what the world would be like without it (if they were even ever necessary at all).\n\nThe dystopian future is not one in which all people get unemployed, but one in which everybody is wasting a lifetime getting a living from a job (the irony!). Who nowadays cares to ask if a job is truly purposeful? So long it provides money for a living, right? If you only long for a job in a techno future and nothing else, then don\'t worry, one day the machines will be literally doing everything useful in the world to keep us going while humans will be employed full time sending emails one to another. This is really trending right now.\n\nBut if, like me, you dare to rethink those old grumpy thoughts about that kind of meaning in life, work for a living and free market, then your worries are in the opposite place from those of losing your job: what the heck is going on, that people still worship jobs, market and money? Shouldn\'t we move along those things already instead? The world is changing profoundly. Why do you still think you need so hard to live under these post-medieval institutions?\n\nThe only thing that is constant along the History is change. If revolutions fatally happen from time to time, then it\'s about time we had a big one, not to try and stop technology, but to welcome it and dump those old institutions instead (jobs, market, money, competition).\n\nThe true freedom is not what you will decide in common agreement with others and exchange in the market, but bypass these things completely, because if machines work on our behalf, both you and the others have already plenty of whatever you\'d be trading for, and life is welcoming to that, although the trading thing has become obsolete. This is a paradigm-changing post-scarcity new reality, where offer and demand were overriden by automation and abundance, people are more free than ever, money itself lost its purpose altogether and we no more draw meaning in life from work, but from leisure and from self-achievement, like the spontaneous seek for knowledge.\n\nJobs are for machines.\n\nBut... are you ready to challenge those old grumpy ideals? Are you sure you want a job so badly when machines are abundant? If so, you can always be employed at some kind of life-draining drudgery in order to, at the end of the month, deserve some earnings in fancy-printed paper (or virtual tokens for that matter), and I don\'t think that new legislation will ever take that away from you if you want that so badly. But if you\'re up to revolution, change of mindset and true freedom, it\'s time to challenge those old institutions and dare to embrace communism (the horror! the forbidden concept!... or is it?).\n\nA post-scarcity mindset is necessary to fit in a world with AI revolution. It\'s already knocking on the door, and it\'s going to be a crazy ride starting now and all along these next 20 years. Will you embrace post-scarcity or freak out because an accessible machine is better at your job? Will you shove people off because they\'re lazy and willingless to work, or will you accept that UBI free money from the government yourself and go find fulfillness somewhere else than at work? Will you go pirate and stand for it or will you try and stop the abundance that the internet brought along in favor of big companies\' paywalls, intellectual property and patents? Will you celebrate abundance when it\'s inevitable or will you be hyped that capitalism invented a way to try to keep itself relevant in abundance-killing NFTs? Is the government still a force trying to balance out the flaws of capitalism while the capitalism drives progress, or the table has flipped and capitalism now is using the government to try to keep itself relevant while you enthusiastically vote in favor of it because you\'re told you\'ll die jobless if you don\'t? Do you stand promptly for free market or do you see the contradiction between the words ""free"" and ""market"" now that the world is going post-scarcity?', 'The idea with AI is to reach and transition to a post -scarcity society.. So people can devote all of their time to leisure activities.. I mean who the hell wants to work in order to obtain money in order to survive?  Work has become a culture but if you have the choice between work and leisure, well i know which i would choose. As for if we are losing the battle or the war, the war is not with AI, the war is with those people who want to harness the power of AI all for themselves and dominate over everyone else.', 'So.. the problem is this capitalist system where you need to pay for food.

The reason was it required you to understand how the computer worked at the fundamental level more so. I've been programming now for 38 years. What I found over the years is I have had to let go or retrain lots and lots of programmers. Most of those were learned later on programming where the started out with python or java. The reason why is simple. They never took the time to actually step back and really learn what was going on under the hood.\nI'll give you an example to emphasize why it is important. A while back I wrote an program to make really really large dungeons for a game. 40,000 room map. I was able to get it to do it in 1 second.\nI wrote it in C++. Turning on compiler optimization alone didn't net a lot. What did was understanding how the program would fit in the processor how the processor would run each instruction. The way different patterns such as sorts and other stuff work at the core level. Even in C++ the initial test program would have take more than a day to complete. Now imagine how slow it would be in python. I broke the program into blocks the processor could handle in its cache.

That's 40,000 random sized rooms random positions you can't place on top of one another, 40,000 connections that can't run through or over one another and have to be random.\nSo I went from a days processing time down to several seconds of time and then I was able to make fully use of compiler optimization and reduce it on a 3ghz system one thread to 0.9 seconds.\nThese days in C/C++ I can multi-thread it because of the way it is designed and get about 90% more per each core.\n\nPython is a lot like this in many ways. If you don't understand how the tool you are using works underneath you can't really select the best one for the job. What you end up doing is maybe trying several methods. But a good programmer looks at the task recognizes the pattern and can simply select the best tool for it.\nDifferent sorting algorithms for example perform better or worse in comparison to one another depending on the size of the data set. One may take longer to instantiate but handle really large datasets fast. While another can be started really fast but anything other than a small data set starts taking much longer to run through.\nThe point is not knowing how the underlying works means you are limited to trial by error to get the best results."", 'The way you look at your fingers when you count with them is so cute LMFAO 🐇', 'Mam Please suggest me.

A basic app could simply consist of clicking a button on screen using the Pi camera, and a simple photo booth style printout. Then, there is the opportunity for further videos on how to improve the photo booth app to have advanced features (like adding fancy text, titles, choosing different print layouts, using a USB camera instead of the pi camera, adding stamps or icons to the printout photos, maybe even adding a green screen and applying selected background photos behind the people in the photos.. like a beach scene for example.

If you manually expanded the recursion this would be easy to see.\n\nWith the iterative example it calculates one value and then moves directly onto the next, it doesnt repeat any calculations and onto has to deal with jumps, not function calls or putting values on the stack, this is another reason it is significantly faster.\n\nThe difference in speed was relatively small (only 3x) in your example here using small numbers but I ran the code myself, I ran it with an input of 40 and the iterative approach took 0.0 seconds, whilst the recursive approach took 30.17 seconds, so as the input increases so does the speed difference, I am not 100 % sure but I think the time increase of the recursive approach is exponential whereas for the iterative approach it is linear. Partly confirmed by the fact that running it with an input of 41 makes iterative still take 0.0 seconds whilst recursive takes 48.88, so it doesnt double every time but it is a large increase, around 1.5x per 1 that the input increases by.\n\nI know others in the comments have mentioned that the iterative approach uses more memory but it doesnt have to, for the current calculation all you really need are the last two numbers in the sequence, so all you need to store is the last two numbers in the sequence plus a temporary variable for the calculation, not the whole sequence like shown in this example, so you could get the memory usage down to 3 integers and the index plus whatever variable you use for iteration. Another benefit of the memory optimisation is that it decreases the time that it takes drastically, when it stores the whole sequence it has to append the list every time, this takes time since it needs to allocate memory, using the memory optimised version it doesnt need to do this so is faster, when run with an input of 100000, the example given here needs to store 100002 values, whereas the memory optimised one stores 2 values, this lead to the example given here taking 0.31 seconds and the memory optimised version taking 0.12 seconds, this difference increases as the input size increases.\n\nIncreasing the input to 300000 the iterative example given here used multiple gigabytes of memory whereas the memory optimised example just used the same amount of memory it always uses, also the speed of the given example was 26.08 seconds compared to 1.57 seconds for the memory optimised example. Increasing the input to 1,000,000 created a memory error, on a system with 32 GB of ram.\n\nOne way to decrease the speed whilst also storing the whole sequence would be to allocate an array the size of the index right at the start, then you dont need to worry about expanding the array or list later, this doesnt get rid of the fact that it uses lots of memory though.\n\nA big problem with recursion is that as the input gets bigger the number of functions that need to be called increases drastically, you are pretty much doubling it for every time you increase the input by 1, so this can quickly end up with thousands of function calls and ending up with a stack overflow, with the iterative approach when memory optimised and only storing the last two values, the memory usage of the function is the same regardless of the input. This may not be much of an issue with small examples and systems with large-ish stacks, like desktop PCs but once you get into systems with small stacks then recursion becomes a problem, this is especially relevant in embedded systems and microcontrollers which typically have very small stacks and very low RAM and flash storage, where having a MB of RAM is a lot. This is also where you will see big difference in speed too since the processors are slower and often dont have all the functions a desktop computer would, like floating point units. Hence recursion is for the most part to be avoided in embedded systems.\n\nIt would be very interesting to see what kind of optimisations could be done to the recursive version of this algorithm to speed it up and potentially reduce the number of function calls. Maybe it could be done with calling a single function per recursion rather than branching into 2.', 'Nice 🔥👍', 'Hey there', 'Привет Маша... Обожаю твой голос...']"

From Kaplan-Meier curves estimated from small data sets with lots of censoring to within-subject covariance being ignored.

One should never, and I mean it literally, use a method without fully understanding the math behind it. Of course, the mistake's impact will differ from situation to situation, but really avoid it like the plague. For example, it is only by doing the mathematics behind the bootstrap methods, which are not really advanced but really boring and painful to follow, that one can notice that it cannot be used as is in time series context.

For example, what does an iPod do? It has lots of memory and it\'s light weight. What\'s it\'s value...your entire music library in the palm of your hand.

Ask questions, even leading questions. For example, ""It sounds like you have data and it shows trends and what\'s happening, but what if I could offer you a little bit more by exploring why it\'s happening?"" Or, ""maybe you know why things are happening but are the things you doing to resolve it actually working. Maybe we could find out what works best.

In a well tested course, the clues to do the homework are in the reading assignment. Keep re-reading until you find the clue or hint; this is likely to be a minor detail on first reading. If there are special cases, think like a computer programmer and how one would code them as ""IF"" statements.  In your certificate program, if hundreds of students have done it before you, the information you need to solve the problem should be in the lectures or reading. Don\'t be afraid to listen to the lecture twice and read four or five times (with breaks in between) and then for error messeges there is always Google. But, when you are doing your own independent project, there is no guarantee that the information you need is in the days readings and you do not have step by step instructions (unless you have written them yourself -- a good idea BTW). You have to decide what method to use because it is not necessarily given in an assignment. You gain an entirely different perspective.', ""I recomend taking at least one college level introductory statistics class (or high school AP statistics class).\nIf yoiu survive the statistics class; any certificate program will be easier (and more fun) by comparison.\nThe problem is that traditional statistics classes have nuggets of vital information buried under unnecessary hand calculations and enormous amount of confusing details. But, if you survive the statistics course and remember the top two levels of the outline (don't worry about the third level of the outline) you will be well prepared (in terms of basic statistics) for the certificate program. Cerfificate programs tend to have the opposite problem, they tend to be very  heavy on computer programming, homework but light on the concepts.

I don´t like shortcuts when it comes to education, because I love real understanding on what´s going on. However, isn´t that wasting of my time? Is this necessary, with such tools? Is it really beneficial to learn programming that classic way, or should I just glue prepared solutions and generated pieces of code? You know, time is money. I´m a bit sad, I loved coding until this was released. I haven t lived under the rock and know this was coming, but I was assured that programmers are still hugely demanded.

I am full stack now. But... back in 2008, this wasn't like a high paid job. It was just ok but nothing crazy like recent few years. Then the tech exploded and there simply wasn't enough people around hence the high wages. I think those days are gone and it was only a temp period for many reasons. 1. The demand for devs due to tech explosion is met now and there is a surplus of people trying to get into industry. 2. Junior positions are being automated by AI, chat GPT can write some unit tests, simple code etc just as well. I don't think it is a replacement for software engineering or complex problems (I found it referencing things that simply dont exist like namespaces etc) but basic stuff? - totally. 3. I noticed outsourcing being a totally different story these days. Attracted by high salaries, devs in Latam or estern europe are pro both with english and tech skills and due to low living expenses, they are better off on 1/2 or 1/3 of US salary hence I am planning to move here too. We have people working in Colombia and I am here right now, and my fiber optic here is way faster than back in Chicago (even in small towns!!! where rent can be as low as $100-$200 a month), plus it's fun and sunny and coffee costs me 0.5-1 and not like 8 back in Chicago. Property taxes are peanuts etc - so yeah, I could live way better off here on half my salary. \n\nAnyway, to summarise, I think there will be jobs, but forget 300-400k for coding days, lol. I think dev salaries will come down and match other office professions like accounting etc. It was just a temp phase (tech grew too fast) and those who been in this industry long enough can see it clearly. Everything went suddenly web like shopping, legal stuff etc. and there wasnt enough people to support it. But while tech matured, you don't build your own store these days from scratch, there are proven, scalable solutions to reuse, same with security like login etc, you use identity providers for that. That is my job, we migrate monolite apps to cloud and replace thousands of lines of code by some cloud microservice instead.  Then tools, something that needed thousands of lines of vanicalls JS, then turned into 100s of jquery and now like 10s of react or vue. This will have more and more effect on demand too.
